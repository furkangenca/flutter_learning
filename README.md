# Quotes

This is a simple app that displays a list of quotes. Users can add new quotes and delete existing ones with a delete button. The app does not use a database; instead, it stores the quotes temporarily during the session.

The purpose of this app was to practice using the setState method in Flutter to dynamically update the UI as users interact with the app. Each time a new quote is added or removed, the app uses setState to rebuild the interface. This project also helped in understanding how to structure Flutter applications using multiple files for better modularity.
