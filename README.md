# My Flutter Learning

I created this repository to store the simple applications I developed during my Flutter learning journey. Some projects are more comprehensive, while others are simple applications made during the initial learning phase.

The following apps were created by following the "Net Ninja/Flutter Tutorial for Beginners" series:
- world_time_app
- quotes
- basic_profile

At the end of my Flutter learning journey, I created a to-do app. You can check it out in my repository!
