# My Flutter Learning

I created this repository to store the applications I developed during my Flutter learning journey. Some projects are more comprehensive, while others are simple apps built during the early stages of learning.

While learning the BloC state management package in Flutter, I created a simple counter app to understand the fundamentals of BloC.
- bloc_counter

To explore how APIs work and how to integrate them, I built an app that shows the current time for various cities using an API.
- world_time_app

This project was focused on learning setState. Every time I added a new quote, setState was used to update the screen and rebuild the entire scaffold. I also practiced structuring the app with modular files.
- quotes


At the end of my Flutter learning journey, I created a to-do app called "taskly." Feel free to check it out in my repository!
