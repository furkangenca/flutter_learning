# My Flutter Learning

I created this repository to store the simple applications I developed during my Flutter learning journey. Some projects are more comprehensive, while others are simple applications made during the initial learning phase.

While learning the BloC state management package in Flutter, I created a simple counter app to grasp the fundamentals of the BloC package.
- bloc_counter

The following apps were created by following the "Net Ninja/Flutter Tutorial for Beginners" series:
- world_time_app
- quotes
- basic_profile

At the end of my Flutter learning journey, I created a to-do app which it called "taskly". You can check it out in my repository!
