# My Flutter Learning

I created this repository to store the simple applications I developed during my Flutter learning journey. Some projects are more comprehensive, while others are simple applications made during the initial learning phase.

While learning the BloC state management package in Flutter, I created a simple counter app to grasp the fundamentals of the BloC package.
- bloc_counter

To understand how API's work and integrate I made this app which is show some of the cities current hours with API.
- world_time_app


It was for learning setState here. Every time i add a new quote it was use setState to.
- quotes

It was for differences beetwen stateful and stateless widget and making designing in flutter. It has a simple counter.
- basic_profile

At the end of my Flutter learning journey, I created a to-do app which it called "taskly". You can check it out in my repository!
